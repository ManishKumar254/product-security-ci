# ---- OPTIONAL: deliberately introduce a misconfig for practice ----
# To make KICS flag a HIGH finding, you could uncomment ONE of the
# following blocks â€“ but ensure braces are balanced.

# (A) Missing block public access / encryption (older style examples):
# resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "disabled_example" {
#   bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo.id
#   block_public_acls   = false
#   block_public_policy = false
#   ignore_public_acls  = false
#   restrict_public_buckets = false
# }

# (B) Ownership controls set in a risky way (depends on combo of settings):
# resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "bad_example" {
#   bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo.id
#   rule {
#     object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
#   }
